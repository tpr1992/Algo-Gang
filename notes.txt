### XOR Operator

`
return nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc ^ num);
};

return nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc ^ num);
};
`

What does the ^ operator do?
EDIT: I just tried it in the console, and it seems to add most numbers, except itself. 2 ^ 2, for example, is 0. So in the context of this problem, every duplicate number will be "zeroed", and the single number will be n ^ 0, which is n.
